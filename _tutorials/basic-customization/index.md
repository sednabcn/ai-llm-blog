## Basic Customization

This tutorial will guide you through the fundamental customization techniques for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to better suit your specific needs and use cases.

## Understanding Model Customization

Before diving into technical details, let's understand the spectrum of customization options:

- **Prompt Engineering**: Lightweight, no model changes
- **Few-shot Learning**: Using examples in prompts
- **Fine-tuning**: Updating model weights
- **Adapter Methods**: Adding small trainable components
- **Retrieval Augmentation**: Enhancing models with external knowledge

## 1. Prompt Engineering Basics

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting inputs to get desired outputs from LLMs.

### Prompt Structure

Effective prompts typically include:
- Clear instructions
- Context/background information
- Format specification
- Examples (optional)
- Constraints or requirements

### Basic Prompt Templates

**Question Answering:**
```
Answer the following question accurately and concisely:
[QUESTION]
```

**Content Generation:**
```
Write a [CONTENT TYPE] about [TOPIC] in the style of [STYLE]. The [CONTENT TYPE] should include [REQUIREMENTS].
```

**Classification:**
```
Classify the following text into one of these categories: [CATEGORY LIST]

Text: [TEXT]
```

### Prompt Optimization Techniques

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define what you want
2. **Provide Context**: Give background information
3. **Control Output Format**: Specify how results should be structured
4. **Use System Messages**: Set the tone and role where supported
5. **Chain of Thought**: Ask the model to reason step-by-step

### Example: Improving a Basic Prompt

**Basic Prompt:**
```
Summarize this article.
```

**Improved Prompt:**
```
Summarize the following article in 3-5 bullet points, focusing on the key findings and implications. Each bullet point should be 1-2 sentences long.

Article: [ARTICLE TEXT]
```

## 2. Few-Shot Learning

Few-shot learning involves providing examples within the prompt to demonstrate the desired pattern.

### Example: Few-shot Classification

```
Classify the following customer feedback as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

Example 1:
Feedback: "Your product completely solved my problem! I'm amazed at how well it works."
Classification: Positive

Example 2:
Feedback: "The product works as described but the setup process was confusing."
Classification: Neutral

Example 3:
Feedback: "This is the worst experience I've ever had. Nothing works as advertised."
Classification: Negative

Now classify this feedback:
Feedback: "[NEW FEEDBACK]"
Classification:
```

### Guidelines for Effective Few-Shot Learning

1. **Use Diverse Examples**: Cover different cases and patterns
2. **Match Example Format to Target**: Use similar complexity and structure
3. **Order Matters**: Consider example sequence (simple to complex often works well)
4. **Quality Over Quantity**: 3-5 well-chosen examples often suffice

## 3. Basic Fine-tuning

Fine-tuning adapts a pre-trained model to specific domains or tasks by updating its weights with new training data.

### When to Fine-tune

Consider fine-tuning when:
- You need consistent outputs in a specialized domain
- You have a specific task with available training data
- Prompt engineering alone doesn't achieve desired results
- You need to reduce prompt length for efficiency

### Preparing Your Dataset

A quality dataset is crucial for successful fine-tuning:

1. **Format Your Data**: Most frameworks use instruction-response pairs:
   ```json
   {
     "instruction": "Classify this news headline as business, sports, entertainment, or politics",
     "input": "Tesla Stock Soars After Earnings Report",
     "output": "business"
   }
   ```

2. **Dataset Size Guidelines**:
   - Small models: 100-1000+ examples
   - Medium models: 500-5000+ examples
   - Large models: 1000-10000+ examples

3. **Data Quality Checks**:
   - Ensure diversity in examples
   - Check for biases or problematic content
   - Validate consistency in formatting
   - Split into training/validation sets (80%/20%)

### Fine-tuning with Hugging Face

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, TrainingArguments, Trainer
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load model and tokenizer
model_name = "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf"  # Example model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Prepare dataset
dataset = load_dataset("json", data_files="your_dataset.json")
dataset = dataset.map(lambda examples: tokenizer(examples["text"], truncation=True, padding="max_length"))

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./fine-tuned-model",
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=4,
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    save_steps=500,
)

# Initialize Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset["train"],
    eval_dataset=dataset["validation"],
)

# Start fine-tuning
trainer.train()

# Save the model
model.save_pretrained("./fine-tuned-model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./fine-tuned-model")
```

### Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT)

For resource-constrained environments, consider PEFT methods:

```python
from peft import get_peft_model, LoraConfig, TaskType

# Define LoRA configuration
peft_config = LoraConfig(
    task_type=TaskType.CAUSAL_LM,
    r=8,  # Rank
    lora_alpha=32,
    lora_dropout=0.1,
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"]
)

# Get PEFT model
peft_model = get_peft_model(model, peft_config)

# Continue with training as above, but using peft_model instead of model
```

## 4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant information from external sources to inform responses.

### Basic RAG Implementation

```python
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.llms import HuggingFacePipeline

# Load documents
documents = TextLoader("your_knowledge_base.txt").load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

# Create embeddings and vector store
embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings()
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, embeddings)

# Set up retrieval chain
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=HuggingFacePipeline.from_model_id(
        model_id="your-fine-tuned-model",
        task="text-generation",
    ),
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(),
)

# Query the system
response = qa_chain.run("What is the capital of France?")
print(response)
```

### Key Components of RAG

1. **Document Processing**: Chunking text into manageable pieces
2. **Embedding Generation**: Converting text chunks to vector representations
3. **Vector Storage**: Efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings
4. **Similarity Search**: Finding relevant content for a query
5. **Response Generation**: Synthesizing retrieved information into coherent answers

## 5. Customizing Output Formats

Control how your model structures its responses:

### JSON Output

```
Generate a JSON object with information about the following person.
The JSON should have these fields: name, age, occupation, skills (array).

Person description: John is a 34-year-old software engineer who knows Python, JavaScript, and database design.
```

### Markdown Formatting

```
Create a markdown-formatted product description with:
- A level 2 heading with the product name
- A paragraph describing the product
- A bulleted list of features
- A level 3 heading for "Technical Specifications"
- A table with specifications

Product: Wireless noise-cancelling headphones with 30-hour battery life, Bluetooth 5.0, and memory foam ear cushions.
```

### Custom Templates

```
Complete the following template with appropriate information:

TITLE: [Generate an engaging title]

SUMMARY: [Write a 2-3 sentence summary]

KEY POINTS:
1. [First main point]
2. [Second main point]
3. [Third main point]

CONCLUSION: [Write a brief conclusion]

Topic: The impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare
```

## 6. Model Evaluation

Evaluate your customized model to ensure it meets your requirements:

### Basic Evaluation Metrics

1. **Accuracy**: Correctness of responses
2. **Relevance**: Response alignment with intent
3. **Consistency**: Reliability across similar inputs
4. **Safety**: Avoiding harmful or inappropriate content

### Evaluation Code Example

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
import json
import numpy as np

# Load test dataset
test_data = load_dataset("json", data_files="test_samples.json")["train"]

results = []
for sample in test_data:
    prompt = sample["prompt"]
    expected = sample["expected_response"]
    
    # Get model response (implementation depends on your setup)
    response = get_model_response(prompt)
    
    # Simple exact match evaluation
    is_match = response.strip() == expected.strip()
    
    results.append({
        "prompt": prompt,
        "expected": expected,
        "response": response,
        "is_match": is_match
    })

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = np.mean([r["is_match"] for r in results])
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2%}")

# Save detailed results
with open("evaluation_results.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(results, f, indent=2)
```
