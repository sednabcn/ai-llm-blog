---
layout: post
title: "Your Article Title"
author: Your Name
date: YYYY-MM-DD
categories: [category1, category2]
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
image: /assets/images/your-featured-image.jpg
description: "A brief description of your article (150-160 characters)"
---
```

### Content Structure

- Use proper Markdown heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for main sections, etc.)
- Include an introduction that clearly states the article's purpose
- Break content into logical sections with descriptive headings
- Conclude with a summary or takeaway points

### Code Samples

Format code blocks with triple backticks and language specification:

```python
# Python code example
def example_function():
    return "This is a code sample"
```

### Images

- Place images in the `/assets/images/` directory
- Use descriptive filenames and alt text
- Ensure images are optimized for web (file size < 200KB when possible)

## Style Guide

- Write in clear, concise language
- Use active voice when possible
- Define technical terms and acronyms upon first use
- Keep paragraphs focused and relatively short (3-5 sentences)
- Use section headers to organize content logically
